--

# 🚀 Project Snapshot

**J.A.R.V.I.S** (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is a Python-based voice assistant that leverages AI to respond to queries and automate everyday tasks. It combines voice recognition, GPT-3 intelligence, and system-level automation.

🛠 Built With:  
- `speech_recognition` 🗣️  
- `openai` API 🤯  
- `os`, `webbrowser` 💻  
- `datetime`, `random` 🕒

# ❓ Interactive Q&A

👨‍🏫 *"Introduce Yourself"*

Sure! J.A.R.V.I.S listens to your voice, understands the command, and either performs system-level tasks or replies with AI-generated text. It’s like having a smart assistant you can talk to.

---

👨‍🏫 *"What kind of commands can it handle?"*

J.A.R.V.I.S can:  
- 🧠 Answer general questions using GPT-3  
- 🌐 Open websites like YouTube or Google  
- 🎵 Play local music files  
- 🕒 Tell the current time  
- 📄 Save AI responses to files  

---

👨‍🏫 *"Why did you choose Python for this?"*

Python has rich libraries for speech, AI, and automation. It’s readable, fast to prototype, and integrates well with OpenAI and voice tools.

# 📁 Code Layout

```bash
JARVIS/
├── main.py         # Core logic loop and command handler
├── config.py       # Stores API keys (e.g., OpenAI)
├── Openai/         # Saves prompt-based AI responses
```

---

# 🔧 Key Functions Overview

### 🧠 chat(query)

Sends your spoken query to GPT-3 and reads the response aloud.

```python
chatStr += f"User: {query}\nJarvis: "
response = openai.Completion.create(...)
```

### 💬 ai(prompt)

Executes standalone prompts with OpenAI and saves them:

```python
with open("Openai/prompt.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write(response["text"])
```

### 🎙️ takeCommand()

Captures voice input using Google Web Speech API:

```python
query = r.recognize_google(audio)
```

### 🗣 say(text)

Speaks out the response (macOS `say` command):

```python
os.system(f'say "{text}"')
```

# 🧠 Data Structures Used

| Type        | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `str`       | Chat history buffer, command parsing |
| `list`      | Site URL mappings |
| `dict` (planned) | Could be used for dynamic command mapping |
| `file I/O`  | Logs AI prompts and results |

# ⚖️ Trade-offs & Decisions

| Decision                     | Reason                            | Trade-off                         |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| GPT-3 over hardcoded logic   | More intelligent responses         | Needs API key + internet          |
| `say()` on macOS             | Fast and simple TTS                | Not cross-platform                |
| Keyword-based command logic  | Easier implementation              | No NLP flexibility                |
| No wake-word                 | Always listening                   | May respond unintentionally       |

---

# 🛠️ How I'd Improve It

✅ Cross-platform TTS with `pyttsx3`  
✅ Add wake-word support (`snowboy`, `porcupine`)  
✅ Replace hardcoded paths with config files  
✅ Introduce NLP for better command understanding  
✅ Use threads for async speech + GPT interaction

# 👩‍💻 Sample Interaction

👤: *"Open YouTube"*  
🤖: *"Opening YouTube, sir..."*

👤: *"What's the time?"*  
🤖: *"Sir, the time is 16 bajke 30 minutes."*

👤: *"Using artificial intelligence, explain black holes."*  
🤖: *(OpenAI generates a full answer and saves it to file)*

# ✅ Final Thoughts

This J.A.R.V.I.S clone is a great stepping stone into voice assistants and LLM integration. It's hands-on, customizable, and demonstrates how simple code can power intelligent conversations.

🎓 *Thank you for reviewing! I’m happy to demo it live or answer questions.*
